## Solving Strategy

1. Apply `GROUP BY` clause to `Sales` table with `product_id`, then select the `MIN(year)` as the `first_year`. 
2. Query the records in the `Sales` table where the `product_id` and `year` in the result of first step.
3. Select `product_id`, `year` (as first year), `quantity`, and `price` as the final result.

## Solution

```
SELECT
    product_id,
    year AS first_year,
    quantity,
    price
FROM Sales
WHERE (product_id, year) IN (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        MIN(year) AS first_year
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY product_id
)
